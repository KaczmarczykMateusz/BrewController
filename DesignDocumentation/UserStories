As a home brewery technician I want RaspberryPi (controller of home brewery) to:
- Use one pin in PWM mode for heating element controll,
- set period of heating element PWM from 0.5s-5s,
- controll power of heating element pin by change in PWM duty cycle,
- controll pump (on/ off) by changing state of one of GPIO pins,
- work with multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors,
- connect to Internet and allow operator to controll it/ obtain data via HTTP,
- let operator to adjust PWM and pump on/ off parameters via HTTP,
- allow access only with correct username and password,
- store up to 10 working profiles,
- store all working cycles data from all sensors with one minute resolution and actuators state,
- storage database to be located on SD card (hint: MySQL database)


As a home brewery owner I want working profile to determine:
- up to 10 profile steps,
- each step's temperature.
- each step's length in minutes (1-120)
- each step's it's type (set/ ramp)
